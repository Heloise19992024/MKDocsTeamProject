# MKDocsTeamProject

Procedural Shader Development Documentation

This project is a searchable collection of shader snippets (GLSL and HLSL) for real-time graphics development, focusing on Unity ,Unreal Engine (UE) and Godot. It uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the Material theme to document shaders, including code comparisons, video demos, and setup guides.

## Features
- **Shader Pages**: Detailed documentation for shaders, starting with a gradient shader (`docs/demoShader.md`).
- **Code Tables**: Side-by-side GLSL (Shadertoy) and HLSL (UE) code snippets.
- **Video Demos**: Embedded YouTube videos showcasing shaders in action (e.g., UE Post Process Materials).
- **Searchable Docs**: Built-in search to find shaders by tags (e.g., `gradient`, `unreal-engine`).
- ** Engine Setups**: Guides for implementing shaders via Post Process Materials and PostProcessVolume.
